    <h1>Outcome 3</h1>
    <h2><u><b>3.1: Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and 
        efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done 
        it in teams?:</b></u></h2>

        <p>At risk of contradicting my previous answers, I think sometimes I just need to keep it simple. As 
            much as things like Trello and Slack can improve productivity in a big business, it sometimes felt 
            as if it was tech for tech’s sake, so maybe things like this do require a more human element. 
            Breaking into teams or buddy partners based on competency level would have been a welcome addition 
            to proceedings. When I say “competency level”, I mean someone who has a lot of coding/tech 
            experience paired with someone with very little. Another drawback would be the fact that learning 
            how to use these project management tools takes up 
        valuable time that could have been spent learning code. But then I suppose this stuff comes 
        as a package in such an environment.</p>
        
         
        <h2><u><b>3.2: Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency: </b></u></h2>
        
        <p>Mindfulness and regular fresh air breaks might help me in the future. The yoga sessions on 
            Tuesdays helped. I mean, this is the way it’s going now, isn’t it? Holistic. Wellbeing in the 
            workplace. But certainly having some kind of peer review/buddy sessions would also be beneficial 
            to me. Largely because, on a number of occasions during the delivery of JavaScript, I thought I
             was going to crack; my brain was being asked to do things it had never done before. So, nothing 
             to do with the tech per ser (there’s a lot to say about digital check lists and communication apps
              in terms of pulling things together).</p>
        
        <h2><u><b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects 
            (what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?): </b></u></h2>
        
        <p>I got quite adept at checking-in with my Trello boards towards the end of the project, as I did with 
        checking-in Slack to see what had been posted in there to aid me in my process (learning tools; extra
         assignments; tips and tricks), but I feel I could have done this from the off, as opposed to utilising
          it toward the end. Had I been doing a larger scale project I may have bought a new memory card for my 
          uawei PSmart mobile phone, for- although I had the app for Slack- I would have liked to have downloaded
           the Trello app, but my phone ran out of space. </p>
        
        <p>I really struggled with parts of JavaScript, so to repeat what I have mentioned above, I think team-work 
        and peer review sessions/mentoring would have been a good idea… It might have also been a good idea for 
        me to spend more time alone working on things I had more of an understanding of (to “crack-on” with the
         task), rejoining the “team” when I get stuck with something.</p>
        
        
        <h2><u><b>3.4: Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions:</b></u></h2>
        
        <p>Whilst building my website, at the same time as getting my head around CSS, I found myself 
            constantly saving any changes made, then refreshing my HTML pages in the browser to see whether 
            the change had been executed. I also followed the little “try it yourself” activities on the W3 
            Schools website, along with frequent research on various functions and terms on the web. This was 
            a good pattern to get into, but not without its irritations for a perfectionist like me, for things 
            kept going wrong or not looking the way I intended, which meant more checking and research. As the 
            cliche goes, more often than not, it turns out I’d just had a bracket or a tag in the wrong place. </p>
