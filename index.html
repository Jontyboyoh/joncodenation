    <h2>About Me...</h2>
    <p>  My name is Jon. I am 38 yrs old, and currently living in Whalley Range in South Manchester. 
        FYI: it is on the Chorlton border, so I'm a <b>bit</b> posh, 
         but not a <b>lot</b> because I'm originally from New Moston, where my family still reside. Indeed, 
         I was actually born in Crumpsall Hospital (now North
         Manchester General), where someone has just died from the 
         <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/greater-manchesters-
         first-coronavirus-death-17887699">Coronavirus</a>. <i>I feel its best to start these things with an 
             uplifting fact or two!</i>. Of course, no one would have died back in the day, for there was more 
         resistance back then. My mother used to promote the idea that a bit of dirt every day 
         would lead to a healthier immune system, but soon backtracked on the notion once Social Services got 
         involved. That's a joke... They've not caught her yet.
        </div>
        <div>
     <h2>Background...</h2>   
    <p> I assume <i>background</i> means "things I've done in the past in terms of work, hobbies and interests",
so here 
    goes... </p>
    <p>My recent career history most comes from working in Social Care as Support Worker with both Mental 
    Health and Learning Disabilities. I did this for the best part of eight years, and was even promoted to 
    the position of Senior at one point in 2016. However, after losing my job for having
    a sense of humour (read: <i>joking with the wrong people at the wrong time... I'm not bitter</i>), 
    I found myself unemployed. More about where this led later...</p>
      
    <p>Before getting into the Social Care game, I had a series of sporadic jobs 
        (Supply Teacher, Admin/Reception), interspersed with short-to-medium periods of 
    claiming benefits. Suffice to say, my CV now looks like a patchwork quilt; each patch looking 
    nice as a standalone, but rendered uncomfortable to the eye when viewed as a whole.</p>
    <p>In a previous life (a term that makes me sound like a 70yr old man) I gained a degree in 
        English Literature from the University of Sheffield back in 2003, and a Level 3 Diploma 
        in Photography from The Manchester College in 2013. Between these dates, I also racked-up 
        qualifications in Counselling (2008) and Teaching (2006) </p>

        (I like this because it makes me look like I'm doing a TED Talk and/or more intelligent than I 
        actually am)" />
        <div>
            <p>This brings me nicely to my hobbies and interests...
            I like <b>Writing</b> and <b>Photography</b>.
            I am currently writing stand-up comedy sets, as well as what could be referred to
        as a memoir with a whimsical edge. The standup thing started when I did an 8-week 
        course, culminating in a five minute set in front of 400 people at Trafford's Bowler's 
        Exhibition Centre on December 20th 2019 (<i>without</i> the use of Valium). 
        The set centred around me going on a hypothetical date with an imaginary girl from 
        Chorlton, as a vehicle for taking a pop at all things spiritual and new age (a strange thing really, 
        since I have benefitted from a lot of that stuff). Now I'm writing one about being unemployed, and 
will probably write another about an aesthete subjecting himself to the logic of learning 
computer code (heaven knows where the material will come from for that one!).</p></div>

<p>In terms <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aspinall.jon/">my photography</a>, I like 
    making 
    <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_portrait">Environmental Portraits</a> of "normal" 
    people doing everyday things in everyday places, such as 
    <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/p/B82G0LFAqsb/" target="_blank">cafes</a>, 
    <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/p/BqSysuSDRW6/" target="_blank">carboot sales</a> and 
    <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp0Qy1MDdH-/" target="_blank">launderettes</a>.
    However, I have also done a couple of 
    <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp0MR9zjcZp/" target="_blank">weddings</a>          
    <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp13nApjjpF/" target="_blank"> kids</a> and 
    <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/BqSpR5vjgUV/" target="_blank">family</a> shoots, early
    myself a couple of bob along the way. A friend of mine (Ed, whom you'll meet in the 
    next section) 
    is currently creating a website for my photographic wares.

    <h3>Console.log("Help")</h3>
    <p> Code Nation... As in Coding... As in Computer Programming... Why? Just why?... I mean, 
    I've always been prone to masochistic acts (in September last year I decided I wanted to go 
    back into Teaching, which resulted in me crowd-controlling a set of kids with Learning 
    Disabilities for seven hours a day), but I've never had myself down as a "techie" person. I mean, 
    I'm the sort of person who calls my mate Roy (everyone has a go-to computer guy right?) to 
    find out how to do really simple things, such as changing the brightness setting on my laptop, 
    so how did I come to enrol on a Coding course?...
</p>
    <p> After picking-up a leaflet in the Job Centre whilst attending my first Universal Credit 
    appointment, I called Code Nation, which led to a couple of telephone conversations with
    Ezra Veng-Christenson (Admissions Advisor), who invited me to an induction interview. Fear of
    programming aside, I was enamoured by the bean bags and big screens of the workspace, 
    so jumped aboard. In the meantime, before starting the course, I had a chat with my other 
    techie mate, Ed ("its basically boxes within boxes"), after which I needed professional 
    counselling.
