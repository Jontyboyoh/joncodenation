    <p class="answers shade">
      Until this course, I’d only really viewed websites for my own amusement.
      Knowing that I was doing the course, I looked into a little HTML and had a
      few talks with Programmer friends of mine to “start the ball rolling”, as
      it were, but nothing would prepare me for what has been introduced thus
      far.
    </p>
    <h3><u>JavaScript:</u></h4>
    <p class="answers">
      Before the course started, I knew this of JavaScript: if HTML was the
      skeleton of a website, and CSS what puts the meat on its bones, then JS
      would be what makes its arms and legs move. Actually, the above insight
      came after day one of the course. What I actually thought was that JS made
      things move and dance around on the screen (read: “interactive
      elements”(1). So I was somewhat surprised to learn that a lot of it was to
      do with calculations, lists and making things work within a website. E.g.
      if you wanted a field in a website for a password to be entered, JS could
      help with parameters that would determine a strong password from a weak
      one. And this is pretty much what I’ve been doing thus far. So if my
      blog/website (end-product) contains any of these things (which I should
      imagine it will do because otherwise what’s the point in learning it?),
      then I will be happy to implement it.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Text Editors:</u></h4>
    <p class="answers shade">
      I used <b class="boldword">Codepen</b> for the early stages of practicing writing code, which
      seemed a good way to introduce the key concepts in a basic environment.
      This is a browser-based code editor, capable of writing short codes and
      functions, such as names and dates etc. I would refer to Codepen as “My
      First Text Editor”, had I not used Notebook++ and Sublime Text before the
      course (the latter recommended by Kenny Wood (2)). Visual Studio Code - on
      the other hand-is downloadable, lending it greater functionality for
      longer coding tasks. It can also be integrated into Microsoft Visual
      Studio (an Integrated Development Environment).
