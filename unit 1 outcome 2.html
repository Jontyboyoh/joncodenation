      <u
        >2.1: Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed –
        in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
      </u>
    </h2>
    <p class="answers shade">
      Until this course, I’d only really viewed websites for my own amusement.
      Knowing that I was doing the course, I looked into a little HTML and had a
      few talks with Programmer friends of mine to “start the ball rolling”, as
      it were, but nothing would prepare me for what has been introduced thus
      far.
    </p>
    <h3><u>JavaScript:</u></h4>
    <p class="answers">
      Before the course started, I knew this of JavaScript: if HTML was the
      skeleton of a website, and CSS what puts the meat on its bones, then JS
      would be what makes its arms and legs move. Actually, the above insight
      came after day one of the course. What I actually thought was that JS made
      things move and dance around on the screen (read: “interactive
      elements”(1). So I was somewhat surprised to learn that a lot of it was to
      do with calculations, lists and making things work within a website. E.g.
      if you wanted a field in a website for a password to be entered, JS could
      help with parameters that would determine a strong password from a weak
      one. And this is pretty much what I’ve been doing thus far. So if my
      blog/website (end-product) contains any of these things (which I should
      imagine it will do because otherwise what’s the point in learning it?),
      then I will be happy to implement it.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Text Editors:</u></h4>
      <div class="shade answers">
    <p>
      I used <b class="boldword">Codepen</b> for the early stages of practicing writing code, which
      seemed a good way to introduce the key concepts in a basic environment.
      This is a browser-based code editor, capable of writing short codes and
      functions, such as names and dates etc. I would refer to Codepen as “My
      First Text Editor”, had I not used Notebook++ and Sublime Text before the
      course (the latter recommended by Kenny Wood (2)). 
      <p>Visual Studio Code - on the other hand-is downloadable, lending it greater functionality for
      longer coding tasks. It can also be integrated into Microsoft Visual
      Studio (an Integrated Development Environment). We were advised to download Node.js to work in 
      tandem with VSC. Node.js is a runtime environment that enables one to use JS from front to back end 
      (back-end = servers), but its main function in terms of what is expected from me on the course, it 
      allows me to use the debugging button. 
      According to one of the instructors, we could not write JS code 
      without</p>

      <p>I used Slack more as a means of communicating with my fellows on the course, and specifically to 
        view the ongoing assignments sent by instructors. How to explain what Slack is/does?... 
        Part-mini-Facebook, part-forum- part-chatroom, Slack is a centralised environment that can bring email, 
        xt and social media messages into one space, so we’re not looking for parts of emails on a specific part 
        of a project from umpteen months back. It enables the user to create new channels for different topics of 
        discussion (hence the chatroom bit). It helped me in my work because it was a go-to place where all 
        materials were placed, including extra bits posted by classmates.</p>
      
      <p>Trello worked well as a kind of digital notice board because of its “To Do”, “Doing” and “Done” 
        system, allowing me to plan and breakdown all the tasks involved in both my website and the remainder 
        of the work for the course. It provided a good reference point to look at throughout, as opposed to 
        losing myself in swathes of paper.</p>

      <p>GitHub allowed me to publish my finished blog and make it public. I did this by copying all 
        source code files from my Windows folder into the newly-opened Repository (the online version
         of the folder). This meant the html, css and image files could all be seen in GitHub, 
         so that- should I be part of a collective of developers, the content could be shared and worked-on 
         by another member.</p>

      <p>I was helped along the way by a couple of websites: MDN Web Docs and W3 Schools, the latter of which
         I’d already been introduced to my friend, Ed (the Programmer). Both sites were a good resource to 
         check concepts and syntax that I did not understand once introduced by the instructors (I did a lot 
         of checking). Despite being told the former was a more sophisticated and up-to-date site for checking 
         stuff, I preferred the latter because of its layout and interactivity (“try it yourself” button).</p>
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2><u><b>2.2: Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate (E.g. Visual Studio Code; Codepen;
      Trello).
      </b></u>
      </h2>
      <p>As mentioned above, Codepen was a good testing ground for me before being introduced to the more 
        technical Visual Studio Code, for I think I would have been confused with the latter’s complexity 
        (the former has a more user-friendly interface). Trello and Slack were equally useful and easy to 
        use. All-in-all, I found everything introduced to me to be appropriate and fit the bill. </p>
        <h2><u><b>2.3: Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project (are you happy with your 
          website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What
          would you change?</b></u></h2>
        </p>
        <div class="shade answers">
        <u class="subs"><b>Strengths</b></u>
            <p>Considering I’d never made a website or done any coding before, I think I’ve made a pretty 
            competent effort. I think the colour schemes work really well, for I have always thought grey 
            and light blue go together. I like the way I have “greyed-out” the text because I think just the 
            black text looked boring. I tried various shades of grey for both text and background (used to 
            separate each question from the next; a tried and tested technique used in text the world over), 
            and I think it is very subtle. I like the way the light blue (eggshell?) of the outcomes [h3] 
            titles are uniformed, and the way I have repeated the Unit titles, in an even feinter grey, across 
            all pages, acting like a delicate whisper. I was also surprised by the effectiveness of my 
            navigation bar.</p>
          
            <u class="subs"><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
            <p>With all of the above being said, I feel my site still looks very skeletal. I think it 
              shows that it is my first effort, but I was very stressed and distracted, and struggled with 
              the “Bootcamp” mentality of the course. Had I had more time, who knows where I could have taken 
              it?</p>
            </div>
<h2><u><b>2.4: Describe further improvements you can make to your project:</b></u></h2>

<p>I just think it needs a lot of jazzing-up, in its current state. It looks bare. With enough time, 
and provided we can revisit it, I think I can get my head around CSS more (and what it’s capable of), and 
bring the thing to life. I’m more of a design/aesthetic kind of creature (I like things that look nice), so 
with more time I have loved to have tried a lot of different things in terms colour, boxes (and boxes within 
boxes), panels, drop-downs, things that go “bling!” when you hover the cursor over them, and general 
“jiggery-pokery”. I’m a perfectionist at heart, and I get stressed very easily. This is a curse to me when 
learning something new because for every one thing that is asked of me several more idea branches grow 
immediately, and from these more branches; for every new idea there’s always a better way of doing it, or 
else a thousand more things to try. There’s not a lot else I can say in answer to this question.</p>


<h2><u><b>2.5: Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b></u></h2>
<div class="shade answers">
<p>Having reviewed my answers to all questions on the course, I am happy with the level of research and 
  application of knowledge that has gone into them. Some questions required more research than others, for 
  there were a lot of concepts and tools that I have only just been introduced to, but with others (mainly
   those referring to efficiency and productivity) I felt I could be more candid in my answers, coming more 
   from the heart from the head. On occasions my answers have been injecting with my trademarked humour, and 
   I always worry whether I’ll be “overegging the pudding” in this regard, but I think I managed to tow the 
   line quite well all-in-all.</p>
<p>In regards to checking for errors, this was a very laborious process for me, the perfectionist that I am.
 I was constantly flipping between the html and css files in Visual Studio Code and what was coming out in
  the browser. This involved a lot of stressing and stuck feelings when I noticed something amiss (e.g. one 
  of my sections lacking the intended shading), followed by sparks of jubilation once I’d suddenly worked it 
  out (e.g. I’d out a DIV in the wrong place or not closed a P tab).</p>
