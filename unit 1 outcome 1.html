      <h2><u>1.1: Describing the purpose of IT in modern business:</u></h2>
      <p class="answers shade">
        IT makes everything faster and more efficient for businesses, from
        market research and the collection and storage of data in the early
        stages of a product/service’s life, through to the customer services and
        after care once the product/service is in the marketplace (1). The
        advent of Broadband in the early 2000s, and the increased internet
        speeds thereafter means businesses can communicate far more efficiently
        than ever before, especially with innovations such as video-conferencing
        systems with use of VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol)(3). Since Cloud
        storage systems took off in the mid 2000s, data can now be stored on the
        web itself without the use of hard drives. The above developments have
        inevitably led to a demand for more stringent internet security, to the
        extent that Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking is a beast in its own
        right. A programmer friend of mine told me that- around the time
        Broadband took off he was sat in his car outside the Audi garage in
        Stockport, and said he was able to access their client data. Naturally,
        he then went into the garage to warn them about it.

        Digital projects use the internet and web technologies to deliver
        anything from websites to mobile apps, videos to games, eCommerce to
        emails, social media campaigns to search engine optimization (SEO), rich
        media advertising to digital outdoor advertising (4). Digital projects
        require a broad range of areas, including skills in Design, managing
        content, analysing data, and the management of social media (5);
        multi-tasking and prioritising and problem-solving are all valuable
        skills needed to manage a digital project effectively, as is effective
        communication between the people working in different roles. Digital
        projects usually exist in matrix-style environments, where each
        department has its own line manager, but the project manager oversees
        the whole project.

        <u>1.3: Plan and carry out tasks using IT:</u>
      </h2>
      <p class="shade" >Like most people, I’ve looked at a lot of websites in my time, so I like to think I know what looks appealing and what doesn’t. I will plan my website in terms of layout, colours, styling (using CSS) and content. I start by looking at some of my favourite websites (and also posh ones, established brands like Gucci and Armani, because they’re bound to be good, right?). The next stage will be to map it all out using the traditional pen and paper, mindful that- as the content expands- the layout will need to remain uniformed. 

        In terms of organising the workload, I will use Trello, which uses the Kanban system of project management (think of it as a corkboard of “To Do”, “Doing” and “Done”). This will allow me to plan and breakdown all the tasks involved in both my website and the remainder of the work for the course. I hope this will afford me the opportunity of seeing what is expected of me in a visual manner, as opposed to losing myself in swathes of paper.

      <h2>
        <u>1.4: Describe the risks that might impact digital projects: </u>
      </h2>
      <p class="answers">
        There are many factors that can put a digital project at risk, be this
        at its research and development stage, or through to how the overall
        product/service is received. More often not not these issues involve
        personnel issues. Perhaps there are too many people involved and/or not
        enough cohesion between them (or the opposite: not enough personnel in
        any given department). Another example comes from when resources and
        funding is shifted to projects deemed higher in priority, or when people
        get caught-up in everyday menial tasks, resulting in the shifting of
        focus from the project at hand. Of course, since time management is of
        the utmost importance in any project, it stands to reason that
        departments not being “on-task” within given time frames can lead to
        overall deadlines being missed (6).

      <h2>
        <u>
          1.5: Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems
          and software:</u> </h2>
          <p class="answers shade">
          The chosen IT systems and technology depends wholly on the type of project being worked on, 
          and how it will best streamline the company towards its goals. It all depends on what you are 
          currently doing well versus what you are struggling with; the latter being a way of deciding 
          where a new piece of software comes in handy, instead of being just another toy (7). These initial 
          questions might lead to a further analysis of how much time is spent doing certain tasks. For 
          example, the workforce might spend a good proportion of the day responding to emails, in which 
          case new collaboration software might be needed, such as Slack or Blink, both providing a more 
          generalised environment, where all employees can communicate in one space. Slack fit the bill on 
          our Develop-Coding course because it was an educational environment where the flow of communication 
          was largely from instructor to student (sending course materials). 
I suppose the first step would be to draw-up a proposal for the project, before deciding on the requirements, 
listed in terms of importance, using a requirements checklist (8).The next step would be to list and analyse 
various IT systems, detailing what each does, its pros and cons, and how it can help you to reach your goals. 
There are so many tools out there that it can be confusing to select the “right” one. Doing a bit of research 
and speaking to associates in the same field during networking events can help ease the burden (9). Ultimately, 
though, an option has to be chosen and a decision has to be made. Anything else would be a waste of time and 
money. Choose one and stick to it.</p>

          <p>In terms of communication and management, they have been very helpful indeed, in that I’ve had everything laid-out in front of me. Slack has been invaluable to me, for I wouldn’t know what was expected of me (and for when) without it. Trello has also been very useful because I could break the different units down into smaller chunks and tick them off once I’d done them, which would have been very messy using pen and paper. Codepen is a competent tool for a “newbie” like me, and provides a great stepping-stone to the Visual Studio Code. VSC itself is a beautiful piece of kit, with its IntelliSense (which acts like “autocorrect” on a text message), and its different coloured text for different parts of syntax (for strings and numbers in JS; for classes and IDs in CSS etc). You only half need to know what you’re doing, and the editor does the rest.   </p>

          1.7: Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital
          projects:</u></h2>
          <p class= "answers shade">
            As the web has expanded, the amount of data being passed around has increased, making it evident 
            that laws are introduced to protect users, and ensure companies remain transparent. I use the word 
            “transparent” because it is now law for a company to inform the user what will happen when they 
            access their website. This is what is happening when we see the “Accept Cookies” when we first 
            access a website. Cookies are tracking files used by websites that track the visits and activity 
            of a user, apparently tailoring the experience (for the next visit). For example, online retailers 
            use cookies to keep track of the items in a user’s shopping cart as they explore the site. Without 
            cookies, your shopping cart would reset to zero every time you clicked a new link on the site. 
            That would make it difficult to buy anything online(10).
On 25th May 2018 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) was introduced as a piece of legislation, placing 
users in the driver’s seat in terms of requesting the data companies have taken from them. This is something 
all companies need to comply with now, with the risk of a fine if they do not. It is now in the interests of 
companies to have such messages on their websites, in that it increases customer confidence, especially since 
customers are becoming more savvy in terms of their rights (11).</p>
