        <h2><u><b></b>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page:</b></u></h2>
        <div class="shade answers">
        <p>I tried my best to make the layout of all pages as uniformed as possible, paying particular 
            attention to colour schemes, repeating the colours of pale blue and different shades of grey for 
            both fonts and backgrounds. I also thought it important to shade every other question I had 
            answered so they all stand out. Each page contains a simple navigation bar with links to each 
            of the units, and drop-downs to each outcome contained within them. I did this by writing code 
            for an “unordered list” in CSS, then by defining the terms for the elements (boxes) within this 
            list (eg. padding and spacing between each box). </p>
          </div>
            <h2><u><b>1.5: Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites:</b></u></h2>

<p>With this being a blog site, it goes without saying that all information gleaned from other websites needs to 
be referenced, and this is what I have done to the best of my knowledge.
There’s so much information out there and so many websites, one has to assume that information will be accessed
 randomly, downloaded as individual chunks, and used in different ways on other sites (must like I did with my
  blog posts). It is therefore important to include a copyright notice on as many individually deliverable 
  items as possible (1).Website builders should put a copyright notice at the footer of their site, so should
   anyone copy something, the existence of the copyright notice will help to establish that the defendant had
    actual notice of your rights, and there will be little opportunity to claim ignorance (2)</p>

<h2><u><b>1.6: Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may 
face when using web pages and how we can overcome them: </b></u></h2>
<div class="shade answers">
<p>Inclusivity is a big deal these days, meaning companies need to take people with disabilities. In the 
    main this means websites need to be accessible for those with visual impairments. Text size and colour
     needs to be taken into account, along with the contrast between individual sections, making for easier 
     reading (3). Colour blindness is also a major issue when it comes to the styling (use of CSS), esp since
      4.5% of the population suffer from the condition (4). They mainly suffer with the lack of differentiation
       between colours, but the website, Designmantic (referenced below) has it that there are three different
        types of colour blindness (Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia), dealing with red, green and blue 
        deficiencies, respectively. This means companies designing sites need to be mindful of using certain 
        combinations of colours.</p>
      </div>
<h2><u><b>1.7: Describe which are the appropriate file types for website:</b></u></h2>

<p>There are many different types of file that can be used on the web, depending on the purpose. Some 
    are very common (jpeg, gif and doc); others more esoteric. For a start nearly all websites start as
     HTML files, using CSS files to style them. Then we have the images that fit into these sites, the 
     most commonly used being jpg, png and gif. Some images are “lossless” (gif and png), meaning they 
     can be edited and saved countless amounts of times without compromising quality, whereas jpegs- although
      capable of detailing millions of colours at once- reduce in quality every time they are saved (5).</p>
